kuyuru shimizu is my life. i can't breath when i don't see him on my screen, idc if it's just a few pixels of him, i can live life happily as long as arts of him exists. i can't bear a world without him being created. i don't need oxygen anymore, i only need kuyuru. i'd let him do anything to me to the point if he gets caught he'll be immediately be put in death row. did i mention that he is my life? because i love him so much i'd be willing to do anything just to be rewarded a few glimpses of him, idc what kind of pic it will be.. as long as i can see him. (don't call me a gachikoi for this) i would trade my whole life, anything to be seen with this man.
